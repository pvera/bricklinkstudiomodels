### Release notes

This model was very fast to complete, probably because I had just completed a competing physical model, I used the official instructions from https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/21046
Build notes:

This is the first time that I find a kit with a proper name plate included in the Brick Link Studio. 

Tolerances: not terrible. This kit is pretty ortogonal, I don't recall pivot points or rotation issues. The only struggle was in being consistent with the repeating sections on the top half of the model. I do like the order of construction, it is far superior to the Chinese knockoff I built before this. The Chinese kit built one layer at a time and had sections stacked with 20 pieces or worse and no additional support. The designer for this kit seems to have spent a lot of energy trying to figure out how to break it into wokrable pieces without compromising structural integrity.

If you have trouble recognizing a part from the manual, you can try to look it up at

I don't think that flex comes into play for this particular model, it's extremely well designed.
