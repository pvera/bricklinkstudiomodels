### Release notes

This model took about 8 calendar days to complete, I used the official instructions from https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/75252

Build notes:

Brick Link studio did not include the sticker for the nameplate (90498pb50), hence the custom piece. 

Tolerances: Slow down while building the support framework, it'll pay off when you assemble the chassis. Interesting spots:

The two triangular frames that hold together the rear of the model can be a pain, Step 111-128

Step 168 is probably easier if you pin the middle first instead of the front one. Also on 170 it looks like the center frame is off to the right, but that's what it looks like in the manual.

If you have trouble recognizing a part from the manual, you can try to look it up at

https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=75055-1#T=I

The rest of the model wasn't that much of a problem, the ones I have seen on video have a lot of flex, something Brick Link Studio doesn't simulate yet. And it's heavy, something that isn't a factor when building virtually.
