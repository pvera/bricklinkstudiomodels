### Release notes

This model took about 7 calendar days to complete, I used the official instructions from https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/21063
Build notes:

Brick Link studio did not include the sticker for the nameplate (4162), hence the custom piece. 

Tolerances: treacherous. There are some placings that rely on pivots, these are all tricky. The two parts of the ramp were particularly difficult. The buildings that are at odd angles were also tricky. 

If you have trouble recognizing a part from the manual, you can try to look it up at 
https://www.brickowl.com/catalog/lego-neuschwanstein-castle-set-21063 or 
https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=21063#T=I

I don't think that flex comes into play for this particular model. Except for the challenges rotating parts, it was  a pretty relaxing build.
