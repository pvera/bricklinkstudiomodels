### Release notes

This model was very fast to complete, I used the official instructions from https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/21030

Build notes:

Nothing remarkable, instructions are clear, noweird/tricky fit issues. 

If you have trouble recognizing a part from the manual, you can try to look it up at
