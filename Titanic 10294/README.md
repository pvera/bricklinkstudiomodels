### Release notes



1/8/2026 Completed section one, Bow and Well Deck, step 139. Spent quite a bit of time learning how to model flexible parts since I needed it for the chains, hoses and the mast cable. I couldn't model the flags as they ship so I just used what was available in Studio. There's some pivot trickery going on in the anchors and the cranes but it wasn't too terrible. 



1/3/2026 Pivot madness, hinges all over the damn place.

1/1/2026 Kickoff. I used the official instructions from https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/21054



Step 11 already has pivots, oof.



Build notes:

Nothing remarkable.
